# SPACE THEME!!!

A [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme designed as a submission for [hackclub](https://hackclub.com)'s [tonic](https://tonic.hackclub.com) event!

i created this theme as a way to open up more doors in the programming world for myself, and with [moonshot](https://moonshot.hackclub.com/?t=webt) coming up, a space theme sounded really cool
