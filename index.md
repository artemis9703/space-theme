# Space Theme!!!

***

**Welcome to the landing page!**

This is my jekyll theme based on exploration, space, and all the possibilities the universe holds.

> We choose to go to the Moon! <br>â€” John F. Kennedy

There are many different stars and star systems in the universe, and some of them aren't too far from us!

<a href="space.html">
  <button>click here to explore space!</button>
</a>

<audio autoplay loop controls>
  <source src="space-music.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
